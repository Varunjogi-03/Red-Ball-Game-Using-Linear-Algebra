# Red-Ball-Game-Using-Linear-Algebra

A simple 2D platformer inspired by Red Ball, demonstrating core linear algebra concepts like vector math, matrix transformations, and interpolation for smooth movement and camera control.
Features of game 

Player movement with vectors and matrix transformation
Moving platforms using parametric equations
Camera follow with translation and scaling matrices
Smooth zoom and screen shake effects
Collision detection with bounding boxes wsing AABB collision detection
